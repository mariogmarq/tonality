# Para Dani

Dani asked me to build a program where a random note is played on a keyboard and then it plays until the next dominant note is reached. So I did that in Svelte :)

## To run

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building
If you want to create a production version of the app

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
